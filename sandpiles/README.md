# Sandpile

The "sandpiles" are an interesting concept in mathematics and computer science that can be used to model certain types of phenomena. In particular, the sandpile algorithm is often employed to simulate dynamic processes such as diffusion, relaxation, or other similar phenomena.

The main idea behind the sandpile is to represent a grid (usually 2D) where each grid cell contains a certain number of "sand grains." When a certain threshold of sand grains is reached in a cell, that cell overflows and distributes its excess grains to neighboring cells.
